## (n)vim configuration

This folder holds my neovim personal configuration it meant to be shared between
work and personal. Originally started as custom neovim config but now I am using 💤 LazyVim

# Currently Avante.nvim fails to build from Neovim, it needs to be build manually

```bash
cd ~/.local/share/nvim/lazy/avante.nvim/
BUILD_FROM_SOURCE=true make
```
