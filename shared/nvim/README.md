## (n)vim configuration

This folder holds my neovim personal configuration it meant to be shared between
work and personal. Originally started as custom neovim config but now I am using ðŸ’¤ LazyVim

![neovim](https://github.com/Raagh/dotfiles/assets/8405459/eefa8d5c-054a-454a-b2a8-9c8aac77db2f)

# Currently Avante.nvim fails to build from Neovim, it needs to be build manually

```bash
cd ~/.local/share/nvim/lazy/avante.nvim/
BUILD_FROM_SOURCE=true make
```
